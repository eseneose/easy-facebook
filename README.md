This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

This project was intented to understand the more complex use case of next.js, tailwind css by building a functioning facebook clone

i use windows 7 and the lts version of node for my pc (node 13.17.0) and this is deprecated for next.js (at least the more complex fuctionality of next.js doesnt work on node version before 14.15.5)

untill i get a new pc or upgrade my windows 7 to windows 10 and thus upgrade my node version, i will keep this project on hold.

thank you!
